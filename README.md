## PySpark Cheatsheet

Cheatsheet for pandas :panda_face: lovers.

While creating this cheatsheet I have considered the time series data of a wind turbine.

### Dataset Information

#### Context of the datset

The collected dataset is for one of the wind turbine installed in a farm located in **Turkey** and has the granularity of 10 mins. The data can be used to forecast the

| Wind Speed (m/s)            | wind speed at the hub height of the turbine                                                                         |
| TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh) | theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer |
| Wind Direction (¬∞)          | wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automatically)                |
